  <h2>Userbase GDPR compliance</h2>

  <p>The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) went into effect on May 25, 2018. Userbase is ready.</p>

  <h3>Does GDPR affect me?</h3>

  If youâ€™re based in the EU or do business in the EU, yeah! GDPR has a long reach. If you have <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/key-definitions/">any EU personal data in your Userbase account</a>, such as names, email addresses, or anything personally identifiable, then GDPR applies. You are a Controller of personal data under GDPR, so you need to enter into GDPR-compliant data processing agreements with any online services and third party vendors you rely on, including Userbase. These agreements are commonly called a Data Processing Addendum, or DPA.

  <h3>Data Processing Addendum</h3>

  <p>[Add info about signing the DPA].</p>

  <p>Userbase participates in the <a href="http://localhost:3000/policies/privacy-shield">EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework</a> to safeguard the transfer of personal data to the US, meeting the GDPR requirement for adequate data protection laws.</p>

  <h3>Subprocessors</h3>
  Userbase uses third party subprocessors, such as cloud computing providers and customer support software, to provide our services. We enter into GDPR-compliant data processing agreements with each subprocessor, and require the same of them. <a href="/policies/subprocessors">List of Userbase subprocessors</a>.
