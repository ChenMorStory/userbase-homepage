  <h3 id="what-is-userbase">What is Userbase?</h3>

  <p>Userbase is like a database, but purpose-built for web app user data. It's accessible directly
    from the browser through a very simple JavaScript SDK.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h3 id="why-not-a-database">Why isn't it a database?</h3>

  <p>With Userbase you can durably store, update, delete, and query user data. But that's where the
    similarities with traditional databases end.</p>
  <h4 id="zero-management">Zero management</h4>
  <p>Unlike a real database, all Userbase queries run in the browser, with the server-side acting as
    a dumb data store. There's no database to manage and worry about.
  </p>
  <h4 id="user-management">Built-in user management</h4>
  <p>Unlike a real database, Userbase takes care of your user accounts. It comes with built-in APIs for user
    signups, logins, and access control.</p>
  <h4 id="e2ee">End-to-end encrypted</h4>
  <p>Unlike a real database, Userbase won't show you what your users store in your web app.</p>
  <p>Wait, what!? — Yes, that's a feature — maybe the most important feature. Userbase spares you from the liability
    of handling user data by encrypting everything in the browser, using keys that always stay with the user.</p>

  <h3 id="what-would-i-use-it">When would I use it?</h3>

  <p>If you're building a web app, you will likely need a database. Userbase can substitute your
    database... </p>
  <ul>
    <li>If you want to build a web app without writing any backend code.</li>
    <li>If you never want to see your users' data.</li>
    <li>If you're tired of dealing with databases.</li>
    <li>If you want to radically simplify your GDPR compliance.</li>
    <li>And if you want to keep things really simple.</li>
  </ul>
