  <p>Userbase allows you to create database-backed web apps using only static JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. No backend code
    necessary.</p>

  <h3 id="why-not-a-database">What does it do?</h3>

  <p>Userbase is a database and backend service, purpose-built for web apps. It is accessible directly from the
    browser through a very simple JavaScript SDK.</p>
  <h4 id="zero-management">Zero management</h4>
  <p>Unlike a regular database, all Userbase queries run in the browser, with the server-side acting as
    a dumb data store. There's no database to manage or worry about.
  </p>
  <h4 id="user-management">Built-in user management</h4>
  <p>Userbase takes care of your user accounts. It comes with built-in APIs for user signups, logins, password
    resets, and access control.</p>
  <h4 id="e2ee">End-to-end encryption</h4>
  <p>Userbase won't show you what your users store in your web app. Yes, that's a feature, not a bug. Userbase spares
    you from the liability of handling user data by encrypting everything in the browser, using keys that always stay
    with the user.</p>

  <h3 id="what-would-i-use-it">When would I use it?</h3>

  <p>If you're building a web app, you will likely need a database and a backend. Userbase can replace both of those
    things... </p>
  <ul>
    <li>If you want to build a web app without writing any backend code.</li>
    <li>If you never want to see your users' data.</li>
    <li>If you're tired of dealing with databases.</li>
    <li>If you want to radically simplify your GDPR compliance.</li>
    <li>And if you want to keep things really simple.</li>
  </ul>
